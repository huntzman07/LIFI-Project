# LIFI-Project
My First Hardware Project

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

Light Fidelity (LiFi) is a wireless communication technology that uses visible light for data transmission. Unlike conventional RF systems, LiFi employs light sources such as LEDs to transmit data, and light sensors such as photodiodes or LDRs to receive it. This project demonstrates a basic LiFi communication link that transmits an 8-bit binary number using visible light, where each bit is represented as a HIGH (1) or LOW (0) state. The transmitter Arduino modulates data through an LED, and the receiver Arduino decodes the light signal using a solar panel and reconstructs the original 8-bit number via serial output.
